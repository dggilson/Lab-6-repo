# Lab-6-repo
Yu Wang, Devin Gilson
#### What this does
The program takes in the user's input to the two following questions: "where are you" and "what's your name". Then it takes that data and repeats it back to user.

### How to use it
Simply clone the repo and then run the "hello.py" file. Then it will ask you "where are you?" and "what is your name?".

Please check out our LICENSE.md file for details but it's open source so everyone can contribute but the idea is still our own.

### How to Contribute
Hey! any updates to the programs direction is much appreciated. Here is the how to contribute guide.

Clikc the fork tap in the top right of the page for your own fork of the repo. Then When you finish your changes, feel free to push it back to the repo and we will look over your code to determine wheter or not we want to merge it to the main.

Thanks for your time!

#### Miscellany
For the license we wanted one that allowed contributors to have free reign to access the code but to make sure our rights to the idea stay in tack. It is straight to the point that gives a lot of power to the contributors but is sure to protect our ideas.
